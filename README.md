# decoder-ring
 A decoder ring with functions including Caesar Shift, Polybius Square, and alphabet substitution.


This is a capstone project from Thinkful's Remote Study Software Engineering Bootcamp.  The HTML and CSS were created for us by the Thinkful team, but we were required to create the algorithms in Javascript to make the ciphers work.

This site allows the user to create encoded messages using either the Caesar Shift, Polybius Square, or alphabet substitution cipher. The caesar shift takes an input from the user, and shifts along the alphabet to the right or left a certain number of letters also designated by the user. The polybius square changes letter into a number respresentative of a position in a two dimensional object known as a polybius square. The third and final cipher is the substitution cipher.  It exchanges letters in the English alphabet using characters inputed by the user to create their own corresponding alphabet.
